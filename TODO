TODO

urgent:
* properly update window size when resized with wrs from wmutils
* gracefully handle unicode characters when xft -isn't- used
* fix taskbar alignment issues when odd number of windows
* add visual indication for minimized tabs

* add EWMH support (back port it from aewm?)
* allow right clicks on client windows to show WindowLab's menubar as well as being passed to the client
